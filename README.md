Northumbria University Wave Tracking code

This is the first release of the Northumbria University Wave Tracking (NUWT) code (in IDL). The code is primarily designed to analyse transverse waves along curvilinear features in solar imaging data, however, the underlying operations will work on any images. Tutorials and videos are included with the release.
